name: Spatial Group Sparsity Regularized Nonnegative Matrix Factorization for Hyperspectral
  Unmixing
description: In recent years, blind source separation (BSS) has received much attention
  in the hyperspectral unmixing field due to the fact that it allows the simultaneous
  estimation of both endmembers and fractional abundances. Although great performances
  can be obtained by the BSS-based unmixing methods, the decomposition results are
  still unstable and sensitive to noise. Motivated by the first law of geography,
  some recent studies have revealed that spatial information can lead to an improvement
  in the decomposition stability. In this paper, the group-structured prior information
  of hyperspectral images is incorporated into the nonnegative matrix factorization
  optimization, where the data are organized into spatial groups. Pixels within a
  local spatial group are expected to share the same sparse structure in the low-rank
  matrix (abundance). To fully exploit the group structure, image segmentation is
  introduced to generate the spatial groups. Instead of a predefined group with a
  regular shape (e.g., a cross or a square window), the spatial groups are adaptively
  represented by superpixels. Moreover, the spatial group structure and sparsity of
  the abundance are integrated as a modified mixed-norm regularization to exploit
  the shared sparse pattern, and to avoid the loss of spatial details within a spatial
  group. The experimental results obtained with both simulated and real hyperspectral
  data confirm the high efficiency and precision of the proposed algorithm.
